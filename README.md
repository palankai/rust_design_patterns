# Design Patterns Implemented in Rust

I develop business applications, usually somewhat with rich domains.

I learned a couple of patterns that I implemented with ease in Python.
(Ease probably a bit of an overstatement, but I was able to implement them.)

Such as:
- [Specification pattern](./specification/)
- Repository pattern
- Event / Message bus
- Event sourcing
- Actor model

I plan to implement these and others in Rust, and I'll share them here.

Disclaimer: I'm not a Rust expert, I'm learning it.
Disclaimer: I'm not a design pattern expert, I'm learning them too.
Disclaimer: These are just example implementations of the patterns, they should inspire you to implement your own, not to use them as is.
